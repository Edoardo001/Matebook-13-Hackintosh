  <h1>OpenCore Matebook 13 build</h1>
 > latest update 09/11/21
 Check releases for builds and changelos

*i have very little time to work on this project because of my work and my exams, but thanks to the help provided by the guys in our awesome group, we've now have a pretty stable opencore version*

 [Official open core guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/), here you can find a lot useful information about installation. Just follow that guide and use our EFI prepared for our laptop. Or follow my Catalina guide and in the post install, after installing clover, delete "EFI" folder in "EFI partition, and put this one with open core.

  <summary> New installation</summary>
What you need:

A working mac (hackinosh or vmware virtual machine work as well)
USB hub for the installation (connected on the usb port of Huawei original adaptator. If you have a usb type c otg connector you can use it to convert usb c to usb a)
Usb drive(at least 16GB)
Further notes and tips

Format SSD to Mac APFS
Use left usb port or you'll get errors during installation
Use a USB hub during installation or a OTG usb C adaptator to convert usb c port to usb a
Versions with Samsung PM981 NVMe need ssd to be replaced
Versions with Western Digital nvme work out of the box

Installation

**Remember update kext in EFI/OC/Kexts(After downloading, to have latest ones)

I've used to write guide myself, but OpenCore guys, have done a greato job, so it's useless to rewrite it, just follow the steps to make usb, and put my EFI folder in the EFI partition

Here, how to build the usb for the installation:
https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/installer-guide/


Post Installation

After boot, mount the EFI partition of the internal disk
/
Extract OpenCorePost.zip copy the "EFI" folder your EFI partition(like in the installation process, but this time on the HDD)


Reboot and enjoy your Hackintosh (Some stuff might not be working perfectly, but Hackintoshing is a continuous process, so read carefully before complaining"

  <summary> Conversion from Clover</summary>
*No dual boot support for now*

Who have a working Clover build, just have to put EFI folder in EFI partition(Delete all files and folders from EFI partition before).
The folder efi must be in the efi partition(don't put files directly in the EFI partition),  so the path must be EFI/EFI/OC and EFI/EFI/BOOT.

**Try this only if you have an usb with bootloader, or system backup to enter system in case of EFI corruption**
